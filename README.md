=======

Simple Python console game written/debugged on my iPad in the hospital waiting room over New Years Eve 2013.

I am an inexperienced programmer trying to learn/improve my skills.  All constructive comments/suggestions are welcome.

I thought about rewriting this to be more object oriented, but I haven't had a chance to come back to it yet.  Class suggestions would be very welcome.
